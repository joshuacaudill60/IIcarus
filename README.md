We are a senior design team at the University of Kentucky's College of Engineering responsible for designing and implementing a battery and spectrometer management system (BSMS) that will be used in a research capsule. The Kentucky Re-entry Universal Payload System is a capsule testbed that is being used in various space re-entry exploration efforts. The purpose of the Battery and Spectrometer Management System (BSMS) for KRUPS project is to integrate a battery and spectrometer management system into the KRUPS capsule testbed that will assist in the journey of the KRUPS capsule testbed from the Earth to the International Space Station (ISS) and back. The battery and spectrometer management system must interface with up to two spectrometers and collect data from them at the stagnation point of the capsule during the shockwave as it re-enters Earth. The data collected from the spectrometers will help researchers like our sponsor, Dr. Poovathingal, in determining which gases are being formed during the shockwave as the capsule testbed re-enters Earth. In addition to collecting the spectrometer data, the battery and spectrometer management system must report the voltage of the battery pack (in volts). Moreover, a bonus feature would be for the BSMS to report the current consumption from the battery pack. The timeline for this project is from September 2022 to April 2023, and our team will be working closely with Dr. Poovathingal and the primary KRUPS team.
